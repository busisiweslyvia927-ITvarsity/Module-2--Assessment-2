                  <p>Yourself and Yours is a film written and directed by Hong, a prolific and vigorously self-lacerating writer/director whose self-mythologizing films somehow became even more self-absorbed after 2016, when Hong unsuccessfully filed for a divorce with his wife. This is the sort of unproductively detailed confessional fantasy that only depreciates in hindsight; the more we know about its subject, namely Hong, and his well-publicized affair with actress Minhee Kim, whose absence in “Yourself and Yours” is glaring.</p>
